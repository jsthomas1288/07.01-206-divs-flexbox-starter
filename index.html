      <h1>Hi, I'm Jacob.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a <strong>Responsive Designer & Developer</strong> who thrives in
        an environment that inspires creativity, innovation, teamwork, and
        overcoming challenges. In my spare time I enjoy helping out my church in
        any way possible. I also like to keep myself active through recreational
        sports or working out.

          I was born and raised in Orange, TX (AKA "Fruit City"). There is not
          much to say about Orange as it is a somewhat small town nested in the
          southeast corner of Texas with a population of about 20,000 people.
          However, the one thing that is special about Orange is the community
          and how tight-knit it is. There are a lot of people there that would
          go to the ends of the earth for the people they care about.

          <strong>My Passion:</strong> I am a big believer in serving others.
          One of the main motivators for me to transistion into Tech is to have
          a career that gives me the opportunity to reach, help, and serve
          others. I have had so much help and guidance to get to where I am
          today and all I want to do is be able to pay it forward to the ones
          who come after me. <br />

          <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I was born and raised in Texas and I have
          never lived anywhere outside of Texas. However, I can honestly say
          that I have never ridden a horse, I do not own any cowboy hats, and I
          just bought my first pair of cowboy boots in December of 2021 in which
          I was 24 years old.
